        In the summer of 2024, I traveled 8000 miles on the amtrak, traveling the country, meeting strangers, and catching up with some of my best friends. Here's a month of journal entries on the road.

       SChipotle with Seth. Hung out in Maggie Daley park. Paradise for kids. Think we’ll bring our board with us to Portland and SF. Stopped by Chinatown. Back of the Yards. View out of the 47 bus window: shipping crates stacked sky high. Got a shirt and a pair of jeans. Had flan from a local supermarket. They don’t get many non-locals here. Yari. Walked past Elijah Muhammad’s house on the way home. Yacub’s third son. Fixed our shoes with superglue. Made ourselves dinner. Slept. Packed everything to go. Born slippy. Took a lyft back to South. Julianna let us in. Did laundry. We subsist on the generosity of strangers. Saw Josie. Test slept on chairs. An eye mask may be essential. Cameron came in clutch. Pack early tomorrow. Trader Joe’s food run. Start budgeting—we’ve been making major expenses these past two weeks. Charged our camera. Shave and look clean.
          <br><br>
      Under the Bean with Seth and appreciated how the curved surface echoes as it slopes upwards—so that images of you layer in concentric rings like angels do in chapel dome frescos.
